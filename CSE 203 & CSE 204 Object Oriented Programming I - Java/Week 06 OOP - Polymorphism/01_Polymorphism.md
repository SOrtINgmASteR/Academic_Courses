Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. It describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form. Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
