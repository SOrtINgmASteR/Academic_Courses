# Data Structures
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in particular ways. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. There are many different data structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems.  
There are fundamentaly two types of data structures.
- **1. Linear Data Structures.**  
  - Array.
  - Linked List.
  - Stack.
  - Queue.  

- **2. Non-linear Data Structures.**  
  - Tree 
  - Graph.  

## Defination of some data structures : 
- **1. Arrays**  
Array is a linear data structure which uses contiguous memory locations to store elements of the same data type. Arrays can be 1D or 2D. There are many operations can be done like `insertion`, `deletion`, `split`, `merge`, `sorting` & `searching` in the array. Sparse Matrix Efficiently represents a matrix with a significant number of zero elements.     

- **2. Linked Lists**  
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements (nodes), where each element points to the next one in the sequence, forming a chain-like structure. Nodes are connected with pointers & data is not stored in a contiguous locations in memory. There are many operations can be done in linked list `insertion`, `deletion`, `split`, `merge`, `sorting` & `searching`.   
There are mainly 4 types of Linked List-  
  1. Singly Linked List  
  2. Doubly Linked List  
  3. Singly Circular Linked List    
  4. Doubly Circular Linked List     

- **3.Stacks**  
Follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Operations: Push (insert), Pop (delete).  

- **4.Queues**  
Follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Operations: Enqueue (insert), Dequeue (delete).
